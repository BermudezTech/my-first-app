# My first app
This is the first project I made with React JS in order to learn the fundamentals of this framework. It's a pretty simple and basic page based in class components. In the main page you can create, read, update or delete some tasks saved in the status of one of the components, so the information is not saved in an external API, but it led me to understand how the class components and the status work.

## Some characteristics
- It allows you to CRUD (create, read, update or delete) tasks stored as an object in the status
- It has a router with to routes (main, notes)
- It reads an external rest API through fetch method
- It has responsive web design
- It's published in github pages https://bermudezweb.ga/my-first-app
